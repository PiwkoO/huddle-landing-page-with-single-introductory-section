## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

In this project I learned more about positioning of elements. CSS Grid came really handy and allowed to make it easier than using Flexbox. Even though I haven't learned CSS Grid itself because I already knew this technology, this project definitely showed me it can be used in various scenarios. 

### Continued development

Usually I use Flexbox to position elements on website and use CSS Grid when I see it's necessary, but I'll try to use it more instead of Flexbox in the future project. Of course, I'm not going to drop using Flexbox. I'm just curious how it will work in more basic positioning not only in complicated designs.
